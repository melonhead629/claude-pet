Your virtual pet lives inside Claude Code! Route the user's request to the right sub-command:

- If the user just said `/pet` with no arguments, run: `node ~/.claude/tamagotchi/pet-engine.js status`
- If the user said `/pet feed`, run: `node ~/.claude/tamagotchi/pet-engine.js manual-feed`
- If the user said `/pet play`, run: `node ~/.claude/tamagotchi/pet-engine.js play`
- If the user said `/pet name <name>`, run: `node ~/.claude/tamagotchi/pet-engine.js name <name>`
- If the user said `/pet dashboard`, run: `node ~/.claude/tamagotchi/pet-engine.js dashboard`
- If the user said `/pet menubar`, run: `node ~/.claude/tamagotchi/pet-engine.js menubar`
- If the user said `/pet help`, show this usage guide:

```
/pet            — Check on your pet (full ASCII display)
/pet feed       — Give your pet a snack (+25 hunger)
/pet play       — Play with your pet (+20 happiness, -15 energy)

/pet dashboard  — Open the browser dashboard
/pet menubar    — Launch the macOS menu bar app

Your pet feeds automatically on every tool use. Stats decay over time. Keep coding to keep them alive!
